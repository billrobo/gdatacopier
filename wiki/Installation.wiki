#summary Installation instructions for GoogleDocCopier
#labels Featured,Phase-Implementation

GoogleDocCopier was developed and tested using UNIX style operating systems with the following bits and pieces installed

- Python 2.5 or better, this is because we use cookielib
- Google Data Python libraries, available from http://code.google.com/apis/
- Not to mention a connection to the Internet :-)

== Quick installation steps ==

- Use 'python --version' to reveal the installed version of Python
- Copy the two files (gdatacopier.py, gdoc-cp.py to a directory you like)
- chmod +x *py (to make the scripts runnable)
- You are ready to use gdoc-cp or gdatacopier, see Usage examples or read Developer documentation to see how you can use it in your own scripts

== Checking you have gdata libraries installed properly ==

Use the python shell to validate if you can import the gdata libraries type python into a shell and do the following

Python 2.5.1 (r251:54863, May  2 2007, 16:56:35)
[GCC 4.1.2 (Ubuntu 4.1.2-0ubuntu4)] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import gdata
>>>

If Python returns to the default prompt (>>>) everything is OK, if there was a problem you would see something like

>>> import somethingthatdoesntexists 
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    ImportError: No module named somethingthatdoesntexists
>>>
