#summary Installation instructions for GoogleDocCopier
#labels Featured,Phase-Implementation

GoogleDocCopier was developed and tested using UNIX style operating systems with the following bits and pieces installed

    * Python 2.5 or better, this is because we use cookielib
    * Google Data Python libraries, available from http://code.google.com/apis/
    * Not to mention a connection to the Internet :-)


== Quick installation steps ==

    * Use 'python --version' to reveal the installed version of Python
    * Copy the two files (gdatacopier.py, gdoc-cp.py to a directory you like)
    * chmod +x (to make the scripts runnable)
    * You are ready to use gdoc-cp or gdatacopier, see Usage examples or read APIDocumentation to see how you can use it in your own scripts
