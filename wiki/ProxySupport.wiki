== Introduction ==

If you are behind a HTTP/HTTPS proxy then this document is for you, it outlines the environment variables you need to set to make gdoc-cp work with proxies.

For consistency, all GDataCopier components use the sam proxy variables as the GData API.


== Howto ==

Simply export these variables using your shell before you run GDataCopier

  * _proxy-username_ with the proxy username
  * _proxy-password_ with the password for the proxy user
  * _https_proxy_ with the url of the proxy to be used for https connections
  * _http_proxy_ with the url of the proxy to be used for http connections


== BASH hyphen issues ==

If you are a BASH user then you will notice if you try and export a variable you will get the following error

{{{
surfboard:~/Work/gdatacopier devraj$ export proxy-username="username"
-bash: export: `proxy-username=username': not a valid identifier
}}}
