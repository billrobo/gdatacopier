#summary Using proxies with gdatacopier, also outlines the use proxies in gdata-api.

== Introduction ==

If you are behind a HTTP/HTTPS proxy then this document is for you, it outlines the environment variables you need to set to make gdoc-cp work with proxies.

For consistency, all GDataCopier components use the sam proxy variables as the GData API.

== Proxy and problems with GData API ==

urllib2 seems to do unexpected things if the environment variable https_proxy is exported.  The GData API is dependent on the https_proxy environment variable to identify which proxy to use for HTTPS connections.

The solution is to use the http_proxy environment variable instead.

== Patching the GData API ==

We have provided a patch to the GData API to fix the above issue. Please refer to the various posts on the forums reporting the issue to the related groups.
 

== Howto ==

Simply export these variables using your shell before you run GDataCopier

  * _proxy-username_ with the proxy username
  * _proxy-password_ with the password for the proxy user
  * _http_proxy_ with the url of the proxy to be used for http connections

*_DO NOT export the environment variable called https_proxy, this will cease the script to work because of a issue in urllib2._*

== BASH hyphen issues ==

If you are a BASH user then you will notice if you try and export a variable you will get the following error

{{{
surfboard:~/Work/gdatacopier devraj$ export proxy-username="username"
-bash: export: `proxy-username=username': not a valid identifier
}}}
