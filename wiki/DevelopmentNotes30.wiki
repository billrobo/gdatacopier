== GData API ==

GDataCopier is written in Python and uses the [http://code.google.com/apis/documents/docs/3.0/developers_guide_python.html GData Python API].

= Programming references =

  * [http://travelingfrontiers.wordpress.com/2010/08/22/how-to-add-colors-to-linux-command-line-output/ Adding Colour to Linux Command line utilities], talks about Python command line utilities.

= Authentication =

Authentication switched to OAuth 2.0, you will *no longer* be able to use Username / Password based Authentication, instead you must authorise against Google's authentication service. 

This allows impersonating domain users if you are logged in as an Administrator.
