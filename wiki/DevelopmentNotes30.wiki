= Introduction =

This is a working document for GDataCopier 3.0 development. Most of this information will eventually end up as official documentation for this project.

== Feature Set ==

GDataCopier aims to deliver these new features
  
  * OAuth 2.0 login, we might drop username / password based logins completely
  * Admin level user impersonation support for Google Apps users
  * Sync option, to prune documents on the local machine as they are deleted on the Cloud
  * Support and test any document policy

Also check the [http://code.google.com/p/gdatacopier/issues/list Issues list], we will fix all reported bugs.

== System Requirements ==

  * Python 2.6+
  * [http://code.google.com/p/gdata-python-client/downloads/list GData Client Library] 2.0.16+
  * Ability to establish HTTPS connections, check if you are using Proxies.

Was developed and tested under OS X, tested under Linux. If you are using Windows and find any issues please report it to us.

= GData API =

GDataCopier is written in Python and uses the [http://code.google.com/apis/documents/docs/3.0/developers_guide_python.html GData Python API].

= Python programming references =

  * [http://travelingfrontiers.wordpress.com/2010/08/22/how-to-add-colors-to-linux-command-line-output/ Adding Colour to Linux Command line utilities], talks about Python command line utilities.

= Authentication =

Authentication switched to OAuth 2.0, you will *no longer* be able to use Username / Password based Authentication, instead you must authorise against Google's authentication service. 

This allows impersonating domain users if you are logged in as an Administrator.

== OAuth 2.0 instructions ==

You will require to register GDataCopier with Google's [https://code.google.com/apis/console/ API Console]. 

  * Head to [https://code.google.com/apis/console/ Google's API Console]
  * Click on API access
  * Create Client ID
  * Choose Installed Application
  * Click create

You will require the

  * Client ID
  * Consumer Secret

Setting these values in GDataCopier

{{{
gdc --register-oauth --client-id=xxx --consumer-secret=xxx
}}}

Note this will be centric to a user, gdc writes preferences to your home directory .gdc/preferences

This is an INI file, you can edit the values manually but it's recommended that you shouldn't.
